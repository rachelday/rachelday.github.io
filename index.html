            Personal Statement
          </div>

          By spending a healthy amount of time outside my comfort zone, I like to push myself to be
          better in as many diverse ways as possible. I strongly believe learning and change are
          constants and embrace them by putting time into acquiring new skills and interests.
          <br /><br />
          I consider myself to be a competitive person, but only enough to guide me to produce better
          work and do a better job than before. I'm a firm believer in “you are what you do, not what
          you say” and my work is a reflection of me.
